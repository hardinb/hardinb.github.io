My first line of research investigates how often various moral virtues (e.g., honesty, compassion, fairness) are relevant in daily life. In a 7-day day reconstruction method (DRM) study, I found that people perceived that they had the opportunity to express at least 1 virtue (out of 12) 78% of the time (Hardin, Zhang, & Sun, in prep). In sharp contrast with previous studies suggesting a paucity of morality in everyday life (e.g., Atari et al., 2023), these results show that people have abundant opportunities to express moral virtues in everyday life. 
To examine which specific situation features create opportunities for expressing virtues, I conducted two crowdsourcing studies to develop a taxonomy of 23 situation features that were predicted to be relevant to virtues. I found, for example, that sharing a space with others predicted perceiving respectfulness as relevant in daily life (Hardin, Trammell, & Sun, in prep).

abstract: 'Grounded in Whole Trait Theory (Fleeson & Jayawickreme, 2015), the present study examined the extent to which people report daily variability in dark personality (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy). Undergraduate participants (N = 297) completed trait measures as well as 21 daily reports of dark personality. Participants reported substantial within-person variability in narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. Trait measures of dark personality were found to predict daily measures of dark personality aggregated across a number of days. Additionally, daily reports of dark personality were found to covary with one another, such that higher daily levels of one dark personality facet were associated with higher levels of the other two on the same day. We discuss implications for future research on daily dark personality.'
